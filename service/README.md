| Water level | EC      | PH      | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Static      | Static  | Static  | Plant not feeding/drinking, change EC, check meters. Usually, lowering the EC a little should get the plant feeding again                                                                                                                                           |
| Static      | Static  | Rising  | Ph buffers probably raising pH. This is usual. Having a static water level is not though, so again, a slight reduction in EC or a res change should resolve this.                                                                                                   |
| Static      | Static  | Falling | Usual cause of this is when media has been rinsed at a lower pH than you require.<br/>The other possibility is that too much CO2 has been pumped into the water.<br/>See Note 1. Change your res and look at the volume of air pumped plus look at your air source. |
| Static      | Rising  | Static  | Plant is leeching nutrition, raise EC. Note 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Static      | Rising  | Rising  | Plant leeching nutrition, Raise EC. An unusual state. The rising pH is probably caused by what nutrient leeching back.<br/>If these are alkaline, it will lead to the rise in pH. Could also be pH buffers.                                                         |
| Static      | Rising  | Falling | As above but be aware of the acid rain effect mentioned in note 1. Res change, plus increase in EC.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Static      | Falling | Static  | Plant eating but not drinking. Not ideal. Lower EC or res change                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Static      | Falling | Rising  | As above but rising pH is a better sign. Lower EC slightly or res change.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Static      | Falling | Falling | Falling pH along with falling EC but no drop in water level suggests a res change. Could also be an acid rain effect as per note 1. Depending on other symptoms, lowering EC after res change.                                                                      |
| Falling     | Static  | Static  | Perfect conditions. EC and pH are at the correct level.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Falling     | Static  | Rising  | Normal state most people encounter. Nothing to worry about, carry on doing what you are doing unless other plant symptoms.                                                                                                                                          |
| Falling     | Static  | Falling | Res change plus a change of EC. Lower EC if over 1.4, raise EC if lower than 1.0                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Falling     | Rising  | Static  | Plant is drinking more than eating, lower EC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Falling     | Rising  | Rising  | Plant is drinking more than eating, lower EC                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Falling     | Rising  | Falling | Plant is drinking more than eating, lower EC. Also, res change due to possible acid rain problem.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Falling     | Falling | Static  | Hungry plant, raise EC. Very good situation to be in. Nutrient buffers are working and plant is taking a balance of nutrients.                                                                                                                                      |
| Falling     | Falling | Rising  | Almost as above, usually considered almost perfect, raise EC slightly.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Falling     | Falling | Falling | Res change. Potential acid rain issue but plant is still eating & drinking. Raise EC on new res                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Note 1
When pumping air into a nutrient solution in order to add Dissolved Oxygen, not only oxygen is present, CO2 is also
pumped in. If you live near a busy road, this may be higher than normal, so you may get a dropping pH quite often. I
have noticed most of the growers who suffer from a falling pH in DWC tend to live in large cities. This may not be a
link, but it could be. When CO2 is added to water, it makes it more acidic. This is the precise process which causes
acid rain, pollution from power stations etc. pouring CO2 into the air, this mixes with the water vapour in clouds
causing acid rain.

### Note 2
Most people assume that with a rising EC, it is the plants way of saying, I don't want more food, here, have some back.
What is actually happening is this. Plant's roots take in water/nutrients through a process called Osmosis. Effectively,
if you think in terms of the roots having their own internal EC. The osmosis process will always try to balance out the
ECs, taking from the higher side of the barrier and giving to the lower part. So if the EC of the nutrient solution is
higher than the "internal EC", then food & water will flow from the solution to the roots, this is the normal process.
If however, the EC of the solution is higher than the "internal EC", then the balancing will work the other way and
nutrition will be leeched from the roots to the solution. A res change or increase in EC should resolve depending on the
other factors such as pH and water levels.

### Note 3
Nutrients flow around a well hydrated plant much more effectively and faster than one which isnt as well hydrated.
How can growers use this? By feeding at lower levels, the plant needs to take on more water in order to get the
nutrition it requires. So by feeding at moderate levels, this forces the plant to drink more. By drinking more, it is
better hydrated, because it is better hydrated, it needs more food, making it eat more. So feed at moderate levels
rather than overly aggressive levels. The method of pushing the EC until you see signs of nute burn is damaging to the
plants and although many growers use this method, I am not a fan though your plants are not mine!
