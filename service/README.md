## What do pH and EC readings mean?

| Water level | EC      | PH      | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Static      | Static  | Static  | Plant not feeding/drinking, change EC, check meters. Usually, lowering the EC a little should get the plant feeding again                                                                                                                                           |
| Static      | Static  | Rising  | Ph buffers probably raising ph. This is usual. Having a static water level is not though, so again, a slight reduction in EC or a res change should resolve this.                                                                                                   |
| Static      | Static  | Falling | Usual cause of this is when media has been rinsed at a lower ph than you require.<br/>The other possibility is that too much CO2 has been pumped into the water.<br/>See Note 1. Change your res and look at the volume of air pumped plus look at your air source. |
| Static      | Rising  | Static  | Plant is leeching nutrition, raise EC. Note 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Static      | Rising  | Rising  | Plant leeching nutrition, Raise EC. An unusual state. The rising ph is probably caused by what nutrient leeching back.<br/>If these are alkaline, it will lead to the rise in ph. Could also be ph buffers.                                                         |
| Static      | Rising  | Falling | As above but be aware of the acid rain effect mentioned in note 1. Res change, plus increase in EC.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Static      | Falling | Static  | Plant eating but not drinking. Not ideal. Lower EC or res change                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Static      | Falling | Rising  | As above but rising ph is a better sign. Lower EC slightly or res change.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Static      | Falling | Falling | Falling ph along with falling EC but no drop in water level suggests a res change. Could also be an acid rain effect as per note 1. Depending on other symptoms, lowering EC after res change.                                                                      |
| Falling     | Static  | Static  | Perfect conditions. EC and ph are at the correct level.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Falling     | Static  | Rising  | Normal state most people encounter. Nothing to worry about, carry on doing what you are doing unless other plant symptoms.                                                                                                                                          |
| Falling     | Static  | Falling | Res change plus a change of EC. Lower EC if over 1.4, raise EC if lower than 1.0                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Falling     | Rising  | Static  | Plant is drinking more than eating, lower EC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Falling     | Rising  | Rising  | Plant is drinking more than eating, lower EC                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Falling     | Rising  | Falling | Plant is drinking more than eating, lower EC. Also, res change due to possible acid rain problem.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Falling     | Falling | Static  | Hungry plant, raise EC. Very good situation to be in. Nute buffers are working and plant is taking a balance of nutrients.                                                                                                                                          |
| Falling     | Falling | Rising  | Almost as above, usually considered almost perfect, raise EC slightly.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Falling     | Falling | Falling | Res change. Potential acid rain issue but plant is still eating & drinking. Raise EC on new res                                                                                                                                                                     |
